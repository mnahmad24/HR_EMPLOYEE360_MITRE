# HR_EMPLOYEE360_MITRE

## Overview
This use case addresses the common Employee360 problem. Our customer had employee data stored across various systems. These were; Workday, Sharepoint, and Oracle DBs. A digital transformation initiative was underway to optimize employee utilization against ongoing and new projects. To do so, the customer needed a way to consolidate the employee data stored across various systems and create a single source of truth, the Employee360.  

This demo proves how the MuleSoft api-led POV addresses this problem while being faster to deployment, and providing a future proof architecture.
